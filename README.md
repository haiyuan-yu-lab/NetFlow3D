# NetFlow3D
NetFlow3D is a computational tool aiming at mapping how somatic mutations act across multiple scales in cancer. If you find NetFlow3D helpful, please cite https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.06.531441. You can also upload your data to our web server (http://netflow3d.yulab.org) and run NetFlow3D there.

## Environment details
- Python: 3.9.10
- Linux Distribution: Rocky Linux 9.0 (Blue Onyx)

## Prerequisites
The Python Standard Library and the following packages:
- scipy (version 1.9.3)
- numpy (version 1.23.5)
- networkx (version 2.8.8)
- pandas (version 1.5.2)

## Installation (~5min)

	git clone https://github.com/haiyuan-yu-lab/NetFlow3D.git
	cd NetFlow3D

## Run unit tests (~1.5min)
	python test_netflow3d.py
	
## Usage

To see the available options and usage information, please run:
	
 	python NetFlow3D.py -h
 
To run NetFlow3D, your command should be in the following format (the contents in `[]` are optional):

	python NetFlow3D.py -m <input_maf> -I <job_name> [-X <expressed_genes>] [-n <binary_interactome>] [-o <output_path>] [-t <threads>]

### Required arguments
- `-m <input_maf>`: replace `<input_maf>` with the path to your MAF file.
- `-I <job_name>`: replace `<job_name>` with a name you preferred for the current job.

### Optional arguments
- `-X <expressed_genes>`: replace `<expressed_genes>` with the path to your file which stores a complete list of expressed genes/proteins (see [Optional input](#optional-input) for how to generate the file). If not specified, all genes/proteins will be considered expressed.
- `-n <binary_interactome>`: replace `<binary_interactome>` with the path to your file which stores a complete list of existing protein-protein interactions (see [Optional input](#optional-input) for how to generate the file). If not specified, NetFlow3D will use the high quality binary interactome of Homo sapiens curated by HINT (http://hint.yulab.org/).
- `-o <output_path>`: replace `<output_path>` with a directory where the output files will be stored. If not specified, the output files will be stored in `./output/`.
- `-t <threads>`: replace `<threads>` with a postive integer. This argument specifies the number of threads to use. If not specified, NetFlow3D will use 5 threads.
	
We provide example input files in `./example/input/`. Here is an example of your command (please run the following command to see if NetFlow3D is working properly, taking ~1min):

	python NetFlow3D.py -m example/input/mutations.maf -I test -X example/input/expressed_genes.txt
	
If you run the above command, the output should be found in `./output/`, including `test_signatures.txt`, `test_subnetworks.txt`, and a folder `test/`. To get an idea of what the output files should look like, please see example output files in `./example/output/`.

## Prepare input files

	>P01112&emsp;P04049<br>


## Output files
NetFlow3D will output the following and files and a folder. `{job_name}` will be replaced by the job name you specified before. If you run the example command, `{job_name}` will be replaced by `test`. 
- `{job_name}`_signatures.txt

	This a tab-separated file containing the significant 3D clusters and LOF enrichment signals identified by NetFlow3D. The first line is a header. Eight columns are present:
	1. Signature_ID
	2. Type
	3. Uniprots
	4. Canonical_isoform
	6. Structure_source (`[NA]` means not applicable)
	7. Mutation_frequency 

		The content format in this column depends on the content in "Type":
		- If the content in "Type" is “LoF_IntraProtein_Enriched”, the format of this column is `{UniProt ID}:{number of LoF mutations in all samples}`
		- Otherwise, the format of this column is `{residue1}:{number of mutated samples},{residue2}:{number of mutated samples},...`
	8. LoF_enrichment (`[NA]` means not applicable)
	9. Raw_pvalue
	10. Adjusted_pvalue

- `{job_name}`_subnetworks.txt

	This is a tab-separated file containing the interconnected modules identified by NetFlow3D. Two columns are present:
	1. Subnetwork_UniProts	
	2. Subnetwork_size (i.e. number of proteins in the interconnected module)

- `{job_name}/`

	This is a folder containing intermediate files:
	1. `Input_parameters.txt`: Records the input parameters.
   	2. `Expr_uniprots.txt`: Contains UniProt IDs of expressed genes. 
	3. `Per_residue_info.txt`: Summarizes mutation information for each residue.
 	4. `mutrate.txt`: Includes background model parameters.
 	5. `All_intra_LoF_pvalue.txt`: Includes results of LOF enrichment analysis.
  	6. `PDB_graph`, `AlphaFold2_graph_pLDDT0`: Includes residue-residue contact maps.
	7. `PIONEER_inter_pvalue.txt`, `PDB_intra_pvalue.txt`, `PDB_inter_pvalue.txt`, `AlphaFold2_intra_pvalue_pLDDT0.txt`: Includes results of 3D cluster clustering analysis.
 	8. `initial_state.graphml.gz`: Input to the network propagation model of NetFlow3D.
 	9. `choose_delta.txt`: δ's from randomized input
	10. `final_state.graphml.gz`: Output from the network propagation model of NetFlow3D.

## The Human Protein Structurome
The Human Protein Structurome consists of two parts:
### Part 1: residue-residue contact map derived from 3D protein structures
- `./graph/PDB_intra/`
Each file in this folder (file name format: `{UniProtID}.graphml.gz`) stores a residue-residue interaction network derived from PDB structures (https://www.rcsb.org/). Each network is represented by a graph, where the nodes are the amino acid residues in this protein covered by at least one PDB chain. An edge exists if the minimal intra-chain distance between two residues among all available PDB chains is smaller than 10 angstrom (the distance between two residues in a specific PDB chain is defined as the distance between their closest atoms in that chain). Each node does not have an attribute. Each edge has two attributes: "distance" (unit: angstrom) and "source" (the residues in the PDB chain where the value in "distance" is obtained, format: UniProtResidue1:PDBResidue1;UniProtResidue2:PDBResidue2).

- `./graph/PDB_inter/`
Each file in this folder (file name format: `{UniProtID}.graphml.gz`) stores a residue-residue interaction network derived from PDB structures. These networks represent interactions between residues located in different PDB chains. Each network is depicted as a graph, where:
	<ul>
	<li>One end of an edge represents a residue in the protein identified by the UniProtID.
	<li>The other end of the edge represents a residue either from the same protein or another protein, but it must be from a different PDB chain.
	</ul>

The interaction is included in the network if the minimal inter-chain distance between the two residues, across all available PDB structures, is less than 10 angstroms.

- `./graph/AF2_pLDDT0/`
Each file in this folder (file name format: `{UniProtID}.graphml.gz`) stores a residue-residue interaction network derived from the structures in AlphaFold DB (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/). The way of generating the files in this part is the same as that of generating the files in `./graph/PDB_intra/`. All residues in the AlphaFold DB structures are involved when generating this folder regardless of model confidence.

### Part 2: protein-protein interaction interfaces generated by PIONEER
- `./metadata/HomoSapiens_interfaces_PIONEER_veryhigh.txt`
This tab-separated file contains protein-protein interaction interface residues generated by PIONEER with a confidence level of ‘very high’ (Download link: https://pioneer.yulab.org/downloads).
